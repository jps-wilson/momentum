# Momentum
Momentum is a lightweight, client-side task management app designed to reduce friction in daily productivity. It dynamically organizes tasks into Today, Upcoming, and Completed views, with real-time rendering, drag-and-drop reordering, progress tracking, and persistent local storage—all built using modular HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
